## osu-beatmap-preview

vibecoded osu! beatmap preview using lazer and [this](https://github.com/Lekuruu/osu-preview) as reference.<br>
created to be used on [osu-stuff](https://github.com/mezleca/osu-stuff)

## features

- basic preview for standard and mania.
- basic skin configuration (mostly colors).
- basic mod support for standard and mania (pretty sure only dt works for now...).
- canvas backend (performance wise, is fine even on stupid complicated slider maps)
- beatmap parser (literally 100% vibecoded, didn't even checked the code xd)
